## Overview

* RFM analysis is a powerful technique used by companies to better understand customer behaviour and optimize engagement strategies. It revolves around three key dimensions: recency, frequency, and monetary value. These dimensions capture essential aspects of customer transactions, providing valuable information for segmentation and personalized marketing campaigns.

* The given dataset is provided by an e-commerce platform containing customer transaction data including customer ID, purchase date, transaction amount, product information, ID command and location. The platform aims to leverage RFM (recency, frequency, monetary value) analysis to segment customers and optimize customer engagement strategies.

#### Problem Statement

#### In summary, the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis has provided invaluable insights into our customer base, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors and preferences. By classifying our customers into distinct categories based on their RFM scores, we've been able to recognize high-value clients who engage frequently and significantly contribute to our revenue. Furthermore, this analysis has allowed us to pinpoint potentially disengaged customers who may benefit from tailored engagement strategies to reduce the risk of disconnection. Customizing our marketing efforts to cater to each customer segment helps us refine our campaigns and offer a more personalized experience to our clients, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
